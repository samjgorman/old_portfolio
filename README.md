# Portfolio

These days, I prefer to use a Notion website as a portfolio for a faster iteration and to stay focused on other user-facing projects. 

[You can view my current portfolio here](https://samgorman.notion.site/Sam-Gorman-6fa0b42db0914ba7b5f65b34afe04588)

This portfolio is a pure React application with no backend.
