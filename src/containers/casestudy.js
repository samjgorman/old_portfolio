     text = "I co-founded Peerlift last year, a tech nonprofit that lets anyone create a micro-scholarship, and enables college students in need to apply and win on our site. Before building a marketplace, Peerlift was a database of resources for college, and we grew to 45,000 users and 175,000 pageviews within a year.  This case study goes deep into the UI and technical decisions I made creating Peerlift's micro-scholarship platform over three weeks in August 2018. I was working full-time in San Francisco on Peerlift with my co-founders, and we were part of the Fast Forward Accelerator, where we received $25,000, mentorship, and support."

As this marketplace had two sides, I would have to design and build for the needs of each target groupâ€Š-â€Šworking professionals and college students in financial need, and minimize the friction between their interactions. I made the decision to focus on the donor's needs first, because as the supply in our marketplace, they were critical to getting initial traction. This case study focuses on the main donor flows I worked through, because they were the most challenging problems I experienced."
