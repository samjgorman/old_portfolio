Previously, I had used mySQL for Peerlift, which has rigid data schemes that limited ability to scale content. Using MongoDB meant I could define flexible data schemas with Mongoose, a popular library that enables definition of data schemas directly in my server-side Node.JS code. Faster development, less codeâ€Š-â€Šand everyone is happy."
